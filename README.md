# 🚀 Duplicate Question Pairs Checker (Flask App)

This project is a **Machine Learning-based web application** that detects whether two given questions are duplicates or not. It involves **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training**, and finally, **Flask-based deployment**.

## 📌 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned and processed the dataset
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extracted meaningful features from text
3. **Model Training** – Trained and optimized a machine learning model
4. **Model Saving** – Saved the trained model using Pickle
5. **Flask App Development** – Built a web interface to take user input
6. **Frontend (HTML + Bootstrap)** – Designed an interactive UI
7. **Deployment & Testing** – Integrated the model into Flask and tested predictions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Flask, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- **Machine Learning** (Text Processing, NLP techniques)
- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap** (Frontend UI)
- **Jinja2** (Templating Engine for Flask)
- **Pickle** (Model Serialization)
